# cityForgeHub
community based city building project

## The Idea

### Assets

All the assets are nodes, where each node connects to its parent node, which it is build on. For example a street lamp is on the road, which is in the neighbourhood. 
All the assets are JSON files, listing all the properties of each asset. Templates will be provided for creators.

## The Hub

The application itself, can be considered as a game, and will develop into a game.

### Stages

Stages:
  1. Building the terrain of the city
  2. Adding districts and parks
  3. Adding main roads

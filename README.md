# BuildAPest

*community based city building project*

## The Idea

The aim is to build a city and sorrounding regions, based on Budapest and Pest county, Hungary.

### Assets

All the assets are nodes, where each node connects to its parent node, which it is build on. For example a street lamp is on the road, which is in the neighbourhood. 
All the assets are JSON files, listing all the properties of each asset. Templates will be provided for creators.

Each asset will have:
- a name
- an ID
- vertices with 3 dimensions
- colour or texture

## The Hub

The application itself, can be considered as a game, and will develop into a game.
First it will be a map editor, then will evolve into a (city) simulation, afterwards into a top-down game.
2D to 3D transformation is planned.

### 2D world:

[X] The Map \
